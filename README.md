Ahem.

> I am Joe. I'm one of many Joes, but I am uniquely me. I'm the messiest organized guy you'll ever meet. My glasses are always bent and my hair always a mess. I've never had a role model and as such am my own person.

I wrote that paragraph over ten years ago as my "about you" when I first joined Facebook. At some point, I copied it over to [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/JoeHxBlog) and added the following:

> Scientist, programmer, Christian, libertarian, and life long learner.

I even hash-tag-ified them - it helps followers find me.

I've been creating content on the Internet since before some of my coworkers were born. My first foray into the dot-com space was with [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) and [Angelfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire).

I learned HTML by viewing the source of various websites - most notably a website known as [RPGamer](https://rpgamer.com/).

I've been programming since my age was in the single-digits. I started with [MS-DOS batch files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) and eventually discovered that [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) came pre-installed on the computer I was using.

Today, I program in Java during the day. Sometimes at night, too.

From 2009 - 2012, I blogged at a site I called [Hendrices](https://www.facebook.com/Hendricescom/) - which is a pluralization of my last name. You can view [parts of the site in the WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20090731115109/http://www.hendrices.com/). I now blog at [JoeHx Blog](https://www.joehxblog.com/).

For a more professional overview of me, check out both [my r&eacute;sum&eacute;](https://www.joehxblog.com/resume/) (HTMLified) and [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joehx/).

If you want to contact me, the best way is to shoot a message to me via [my Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/JoeHxBlog/).
